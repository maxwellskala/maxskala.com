    <h1>Maxwell Skala</h1>
    <p>
      Max is a graduate of Northeastern University (Computer Science and Mathematics) with a passion for software engineering. He cut his teeth with a 7-month stint at Boston startup <a href="http://www.testive.com" target="_tab">Testive</a> where he worked in a Django backend and Backbone frontend to help with v3 of the Testive web app (a complete ground-up rebuild).
    </p>
    <p>
      His second position was 7 months with another startup: <a href="http://www.odysys.com" target="_tab">Odysys</a> in Bend, OR where he spent his time curating the mobile experience for the Odysys app and building new features such as competitor price analysis in PHP. During this time, he was lucky enough to ride the coattails of the Odysys team to a victory at the <a href="http://bendvc.edcoinfo.com/present/past-winners/" target="_tab">Bend Venture Conference</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his final co-op before graduating Northeastern, Max spent 6 months at <a href="http://www.hubspot.com" target="_tab">HubSpot</a> in Cambridge, MA where he was introduced to the wonders of modern JavaScript. All it took was one taste of ES6, React, and Redux to reel him in for good. As one of two frontend engineers on the Projects team, he received a crash course in modern single page app development, getting up to speed on the differences in frontend JavaScript since his last foray with Testive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunities for growth and development as an engineer at HubSpot proved too great to resist, and Max returned full time in August 2017. Since coming back, he has worked in the Content group: first on the CMS tools (namely blog publishing) and currently as part of the Inline Editing team, which owns HubSpot's Draft.js and TinyMCE implementations. The chance to work on nitty-gritty technical problems in support of customer-facing teams has Max more excited about engineering than he's ever been before.
