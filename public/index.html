    <h1>Maxwell Skala</h1>
    <p>
      Max is a soon-to-be graduate of Northeastern University (Computer Science and Mathematics) with a budding passion for web development. He cut his teeth with a 7-month stint at
      <a href='http://www.testive.com' target='_tab'>Testive</a> in downtown Boston where he worked in a Django backend and Backbone frontend to help with v3 of the Testive web app (a complete ground-up rebuild).
    </p>
    <p>
      Most recently he spent 6 months at <a href='http://www.hubspot.com' target='_tab'>HubSpot</a> in Cambridge, MA where he was introduced to the wonders of modern JavaScript. All it took was one taste of React/Redux with ES6 and he was hooked. As one of two frontend engineers on the Projects team, he ran the gamut from building new features, fixing old ones, and testing the whole shebang with Selenium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max is currently seeking a position writing JavaScript (preferrably React but feel free to convince him otherwise) which will allow him to pursue his passion for the outdoors (rock climbing and snowboarding). Ideal locations are Seattle, Salt Lake City, and Boulder (i.e. not the ice-covered "mountains" and soggy stone of New England).
